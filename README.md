# Monthly Expenses Manager ðŸ’°
A simple C++ console application I made with my colleagues in our sophomore year of CS.
# Overview
We used various Data Structures in C++ like Array Lists, Linked Lists, and Stack to manage user's monthly expenses. The user enters the amount of money available for this month. The user can enter how much
he spent on a certain purchase. The program manages those expenses and filters them by the day they were spent, the amount spent on them, or the category of the purchase. The program saves those expenses
in a text file if the user wants to return to the program later.
